# Game Dev Portfolio
Hello friends ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Skye Hoefling and I like building games. If you are here, you probably want to check out some of the demos and games I have built. Keep scrolling, if you want to learn a little bit about me head to the next section

## About Me - Skye Hoefling
I am a Lead and Open Source Software Engineer and have specialized in mobile and cross-platform development technologies in the C#/.NET community. I also have a background in C++ and image processing including GPU kernel development. My latest open source contributions have brought these 2 worlds together which has been a lot of fun.

## What is this Repository?
This repository is a collection of game demos, jams, and other game dev projects that I have built. They are here as part of a learning process for me, and I do hope some of the code and projects available help someone else after me. Remember - none of us is as smart as all of us â™¥

# Projects

## Current Project - Adventures of Skye
**Genre:** Action RPG

Adventures of Skye is a small Action RPG where you can control one of 2 woman heros that are traveling through a forest. 

This game is still a WIP and I have not published the repository just yet. Below is a WIP video with some of the combat engine working.


## PuzzleBot
**Genre:** Puzzle

**Repository**: https://github.com/SkyeHoefling/PuzzleBot

PuzzleBot is a small puzzle game that is based off the Unreal Engine 5 "My frist game" tutorial. Which walks game developers through building their first game in Unreal Engine 5 using the blueprint system. This project took the lessons I learned and updated as much of the code to C++ as a learning experience to better understand the Unreal Engine 5 SDK.

You control a robot that has the ability to drop markers or orbs. When you do this the NPC robot will go to that location. The objective of the game is to open locked doors by guiding the NPC robots to platforms so the door will open.

**Notable Features**

* Minimap
* Minimap events - when doors open a quick video feed displays over minimap
* Post-processing render - see outline character behind walls
* NPC navigation
